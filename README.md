The Box Stacking Problem (BSP) consists of stacking boxes of various heights, lenghts, and widths so as to construct the tallest stack of boxes. Boxes can be rotated in any direction, but a box can only be used once. A box can only be stacked on top of another if its length and width are strictly lower than those of the box underneath. We assume w.l.o.g. that the width of a box is lower or equal than its length.
